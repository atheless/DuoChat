# API Reference

PicMo is divided into several different packages. Depending on your use case you may not need all packages. This helps keep your bundle size down.

The packages are:

## [picmo](../category/picmo)

The core picker package. This one is required for all other packages to work. It allows you to create inline
pickers using native emoji rendering.

## [@picmo/popup-picker](../category/picmopopup-picker)

An add-on package that adds support for creating popup pickers.

## [@picmo/renderer-twemoji](../category/picmorenderer-twemoji)

An add-on package that adds support for rendering emojis using the [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) library.
