# `Position`

Defines the positioning rules for a popup picker. Can be one of:

- A [`FixedPosition`](./fixed-position) to position the picker to a fixed point in the viewport
- One of the [positioning values supported by Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/docs/computePosition#placement) for an explicit relative placement
- The special value `auto` which will use Floating UI's auto-placement algorithm.
