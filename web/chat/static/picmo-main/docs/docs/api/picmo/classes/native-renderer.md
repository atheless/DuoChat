# `NativeRenderer`

Renders emojis using the native operating system font glyphs.

```
import { NativeRenderer } from 'picmo';
```

<pre>
class NativeRenderer extends <a href="renderer">Renderer</a>
</pre>

:::note

You usually won't need to import this if you want native emojis, as the `NativeRenderer` is the default renderer when none is explicitly specified.
